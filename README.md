## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge involved some interesting aspects like progress indicator for storage data and making a message box with a triangle at the bottom. I also had to use absolute positioning  in a couple of places to position different elements.

### Continued-Development
I would like to work on projects with different layouts and focus on making them responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Create a custom-styled progress bar with Pure CSS and HTML](https://nikitahl.com/progress-bar-css) - Nikita Hlopov - This article gives good information on how to make cross browser friendly progress bar. This was useful in making the indicator for storage data.

- [Chat Bubbles in CSS](https://codepen.io/Founts/pen/AJyVOr) - Jason Founts - This codepen helped in getting the triangle flush to the bottom right of the message box.
